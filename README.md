# 🚀 NASA Space App Challenge

## 🌌 [COSMIC-EXPLORER] 

Welcome to COSMIC EXPLORER, our exciting project developed during the **NASA Space Challenge 2024** !

This innovative, gamified, and inclusive educational tool is designed to make the most of the available data on exoplanets. Through this project, we aim to transform the learning paradigm and inspire new generations to invest in the future of science and space exploration.

The adventure begins by navigating through space, where an onboard robot informs us of a navigation system failure that prevents our return to the base. As astronauts, we take the initiative to ask the robot to guide us through the stars and known constellations. Using a gamified interface, we will be challenged to identify various constellations within our Solar System. Once the mission is completed, we’ll be able to orient ourselves and make our way back.

Thanks to this intriguing journey, NASA will open the doors for us to explore exoplanets thousands of light-years away. There, we’ll carry out research missions and create a constellation map to facilitate future explorations.

The platform will feature an interactive screen where exoplanets will be visualized orbiting in space, displaying their topography and terrain, along with relevant information about each one. We will have the option to explore randomly or search for a specific exoplanet and, once chosen, travel to it to begin our exploration and start drawing our constellations.

Additionally, we propose implementing a constellation registration system in a database, allowing users to register their constellations. Through a global contest, each constellation can be voted on, with the opportunity for NASA to approve and add it to the exoplanet constellation map.

## 🌟 Features

- 🌍 **Spatial Data Analysis**
For development, we utilized NASA's exoplanet datasets crossed with the NASA Exoplanets Archive to find the stars and their positions relative to the exoplanet. By transforming this data, we can convert it into three-dimensional coordinates for visualizing how the stars would appear from that exoplanet in our applications. Other data from the exoplanets will be used to feed an AI model that can represent an approximate visualization of how the planet would look.

- 📊 **Cross-Platform Application**
Once the data is obtained, we use different platforms—web, mobile, and VR—to adapt our educational tool for different ages, ranging from a simpler web, mobile, and tablet application for children to an immersive virtual reality experience for a more adolescent audience.

- 🛰️ **Educational Tool** 
Through gamification, we aim to blend gaming and immersive experience to entertain, educate, and foster a passion for science in new generations.
